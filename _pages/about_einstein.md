<!-- I am a PhD student at the Department pf Earth and Planetary Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin. I am working with Dr. Sergey Fomel and Dr. Andrey Bakulin in the Texas Consortium for Computational Seismology at Bureau of Economic Geology.

My research area includes developing novel algorithms for subsurface imaging. I am currently working on seismic speckle noise which is generated by small scale near-surface scattering, similar to speckle noise in acoustics and optics. -->
